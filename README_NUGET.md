# Fostrian

Fostrian is a nodal data structure format created for use with [Foster](https://github.com/haltroy/Foster).
Each data can represent any single type of data (string, integer, long, float etc.) and can have multiple subnodes that can hold more data.

Fostrian can be used on any .NET Project that supports [.NET Standard 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/v2.1.0/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md#platform-support).

The rest of this document is available in [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/haltroy/Fostrian).
