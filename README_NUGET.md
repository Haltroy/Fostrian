# Fostrian

Fostrian is a nodal data structure format created for use with [Foster](https://github.com/haltroy/Foster).
Each data can represent any single type of data (string, integer, long, float etc.) and can have multiple sub nodes that can hold more data.

Fostrian can be used on any .NET Project that supports [.NET Standard 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/v2.1.0/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md#platform-support).

After installing Fostrian, add `LibFoster` to your usings:

- VB: add `Imports LibFoster` to top
- C#: add `using LibFoster;` to top
